## Technologies üõ†Ô∏è
- **pywebview**: For displaying a WebView-based interface.
- **pyautogui**: For automating mouse and keyboard operations.
- **pyperclip**: For clipboard functionalities.
- **PyYAML**: For managing configuration files.
- **Python**: The primary programming language.

## Getting Started üöÄ
1. Install the required libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install pywebview pyautogui pyperclip pyyaml
    ```
2. **Configuration File (.ccw)**:  
   Create or update the `.ccw` file in your home directory with the following sections. **All sections must be preserved for proper operation.**
   
   - **Window Configuration**:  
     Specifies the initial window position of the WebView.
     ```yaml
     window:
         x: 1500   # X position (initial window X-coordinate)
         y: 10     # Y position (initial window Y-coordinate)
     ```
     
   - **Cursor Configuration**:  
     Specifies the cursor position used for automated mouse movement, click, and paste actions.
     ```yaml
     cursor:
         x: 1877   # Cursor X position
         y: 932    # Cursor Y position
     ```
     
   - **Keyword Configuration**:  
     Specifies the trigger keyword used in the recognized speech message.  
     If the recognized message contains this trigger (e.g., "Enter"), the trigger is removed from the text, the remaining text is pasted, and an Enter key is simulated.
     ```yaml
     keyword:
         trigger: "Enter"  # Trigger keyword for processing the recognized text
     ```

3. Launch the application and enjoy seamless voice command control!
